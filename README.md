# Breast-Cancer-Detection

- This project trains and deploys an Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model to classify unseen data as Malignant (M) or Benign (B).  
- Compared all machine learning models and deployed the XGBoost algorithm out of all.
- Tuned the hyperparameters to increase the accuracy of the model from 97% to 99%.
